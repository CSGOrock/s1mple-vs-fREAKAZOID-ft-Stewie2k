## Transcript

Below is a transcript with some annotations to present the context.

From `tarik`'s stream:

    (chat) fer: ns god
    (chat) s1mple: not god
    (chat) s1mple: ty
    (chat) fer: good, but not god?
    (chat) s1mple: yes!
    (chat) ptr: Keepo

`fREAKAZOID` joins teamspeak *of a game he is not part of* (apparently using `Stewie2k`'s PC):

    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Shut up s1mple, you fucking suck!
    (voice) s1mple: Who is talking? OMG
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Shut up. You suck.
    (voice) s1mple: top100 player in NA? Is it you? ... Hey?
    (voice) s1mple: Peter, who is talking to me?

`s1mple` thinks he is talking to `Stewie2k`, judging by the *"top100 player"* remark.

    (voice) ptr: One pushed mid, 3hp, I had bomb for some reason. He is right there.
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: s1mple, why do you aim at the ground when you run around?

Then some in-game callouts:

    (voice) ptr: One pushed mid, 3hp, I had bomb for some reason. He is right there.
    (voice) tarik: 4hp
    (voice) ptr: 4hp at top left..
    (voice) SileNt: NOOOoooo, ... [inaudible]
    (voice) ptr: 4hp
    (voice) [help]: go dude, he's in my head
    (voice) [help]: he's in my head right now, dude

Here `s1mple` may have thought it was `SileNt`, not `fREAKAZOID`, who started insults:

    (voice) s1mple: ?, stfu
    (voice) SileNt: What did you do this round s1mple? died?
    (voice) s1mple: What are you doing. ..? Should just die, like you die in.... [interrupted]
    (voice) SileNt: What are you SAAAaaaaying?!
    [SileNt dies]
    (voice) s1mple: nice
    
`SileNt` understanding that `s1mple` has no clue that `fREAKAZOID` is in the chat:
    
    (voice) SileNt: You are not making any sense! (laugh)
    
`s1mple` tries to insult `SileNt`:
    
    (voice) s1mple: Man, do you have a HLTV picture, photo, I don't know. Haha.

Implying SileNt doesn't have an HLTV profile.

    (voice) SileNt: OMG!
    (voice) [help]: I don't know dude.
    (voice) [help]: I don't even know what is going on.

`fREAKAZOID` starts talking again and `s1mple` realizes that it wasn't `SileNt` but what he thinks is `Stewie2k`, who tries to be toxic:

    (voice) fREAKAZOID: s1mple, why you're such a noob, dude?
    (voice) s1mple: Why? [meaning: why are you asking me?]
    (voice) tarik: Hihihi
    (voice) SileNt: That's what you answer..
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: You're such a baiter, dude.

Here you can see again `s1mple` thinks he is talking to `Stewie2k`:

    (voice) s1mple: Stewie, please STFU. Seriously.

`fREAKAZOID` continues insulting, and `s1mple` fires back saying he does not understand
why `Stewie2k` is playing for `Cloud9` given his `~0.5` LAN K/D ratio.

    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Stop baiting for kills, dude. You suck.
    (voice) s1mple: I don't know how you are playing for C9.
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: I don't know how you are playing for any team.
    (voice) s1mple: cuz 0.5 K/D ratio.... [inaudible]
    
Now `fREAKAZOID` tries to insult `s1mple` in a way to show his short stay in teams he played for, however,
is disappointed when learns that he played for a whole 1 year with `Hellraisers`:
    
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: What's the longest team you have ever been in your life? Couple of months?
    (voice) s1mple: I think, 1 year with Hellraisers.
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Oh, WOW!
    
After the unsuccessful avenue of attack, he tries a little different one:
    
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: How long that ... Are you guys still fiends though?
    (voice) s1mple: Yeah.

`s1mple` still thinking he is talking to `Stewie2k`:

    (voice) s1mple: How long have you been in this team? hehe
    (voice) s1mple: Better answer on this question.

Here it could be that `fREAKAZOID` does not understand that `s1mple` actually thinks he is talking with `Stewie2k`:

    (voice) fREAKAZOID: How long have you been on Liquid?

`s1mple` had enough and starts firing back at `Stewie2k`:

    (voice) s1mple: How its good when everyone hates you? On Reddit, everywhere.
    (voice) s1mple: How its good when you are pushing in smoke and [??] in smoke when you are...
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Do you even have real life friends?

`SileNt`, after hearing `s1mple` say "pushing in smoke", suspects that `s1mple` thinks he is talking to `Stewie2k`:

    (voice) SileNt: Do you even know who you are talking to?
    (voice) s1mple: hehe.. [awkward haha]
    
`fREAKAZOID` continues with insults:    

    (voice) fREAKAZOID: You don't have real life friends, do you?
    (voice) s1mple: Yeah, I have [???] fiends as well.
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: [???] Hit the soft spot, dude.
    (voice) SileNt: HAHAhhaha
    
Now a typical *'cya lan'* insult: 
    
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Do ya have any balls? Or, nah?
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Or your just cocking online?
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: And get scared in person, hah?

`tarik` thinks `fREAKAZOID` went a bit far:

    (voice) tarik: WTF?! [smile]

`s1mple` shooting back at the fake `Stewie2k`, by the *"Everyone hates you"* quote you can see he still
 thinks he is talking to `Stewie2k`:

    (voice) s1mple: [???] Why are you talking to me?
    (voice) s1mple: Everyone hates you. I don't want to talking with you, as well.
    (voice) s1mple: You can try to talk with Reddit, HLTV, but not with me.
    (voice) s1mple: Please.

Then they go on to insult each other:

    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Hey, at least Reddit talks back, dude.
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: You can't even have a conversation.
    (voice) s1mple: Stewie, everyone talking that you are shit. Come on.
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: [??]
    (voice) s1mple: You should play better.
    (voice) s1mple: Go DM (death match), stop talking, go DM, do something.
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Man, have you seen [?? rain?], [??] sucks dick.
    (voice) s1mple: Agh, OK.

Now some strange insult from `fREAKAZOID` and he follows with implying that `s1mple` is too pale:

    (voice) fREAKAZOID: You rush for kills and still die?!
    (voice) s1mple: OK, what, stop talking to me, please.
    (voice) s1mple: Don't want to talk with you. Hey, seriously.
    (voice) s1mple: Seriously!
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Hey seriously, dude, its time for a tan. [implying s1mple needs a tan]

Again, `tarik` probably thinks guys went too far:

    (voice) tarik: guys...

    [inaudible]

`s1mple` strikes back:

    (voice) s1mple: Stop talking with me
    (voice) s1mple: [..] sucking dick every official match.
    (voice) s1mple: So please, don't talk with me.
    (voice) s1mple: Or you try talking when a north... [get's interrupted]
    
`fREAKAZOID` impersonates `s1mple` in his voice:
    
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Hey, stop losing rounds.
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Dude, you keep talking to me.
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Shut up!! You suuuck!
    (voice) SileNt: Hahahahheehe....

Then `fREAKAZOID` goes on with stupid insults, considering `s1mple` is a way more skilled player:

    (voice) fREAKAZOID: You aim at the ground, you run around.
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: It's so bad, you need to tan and get some [...]
    (voice) s1mple: Who? Who losing rounds? What are you talking about?
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Man, you lose your team so many rounds, bro.
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: God damn, I've seen you play.
    (voice) s1mple: And [..] you?
    
Here `fREAKAZOID` says he *"jumps through smokes"*, now it is not clear whether he mentions
it here because `s1mple` said that before, or he actually understands that `s1mple` thinks
he is talking with `Stewie2k` and tries to impersonate `Stewie2k`:
    
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: I like jumping through smokes.
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Man, what can I say.
     
    (voice) s1mple: You'r...hehe.. [get's interrupted]
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: I make plays, you make dumb plays.
    (voice) s1mple: You make plays? Please.
    (voice) s1mple: Seriously, you are the worst player in Cloud9.
    (voice) s1mple: Seriously.
    (voice) s1mple: You should play better, go death-match.
    
Now, when talking about *baiting* it actully bites `s1mple` for the first time:

    (voice) fREAKAZOID: You are the best player on every other team,
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: just because you steal kills.

    (voice) s1mple: No I'm not stel.. [??]
    (voice) s1mple: In every team I was open-killer or I was lurker, or AWP player.
    (voice) s1mple: If you don't know anything about me, so STFU.
    (voice) s1mple: Because... when you play at LAN, try to talk with me, 0.5 K/D ratio.
    (voice) s1mple: I don't even want to talk to you, seriously, you are shit...
    (voice) s1mple: You're peace of fucking shit player.

After provoking `s1mple`, now `fREAKAZOID` tries to snub `s1mple`, and `tarik` is shutting down
his stream after the match.

    (voice) tarik: OK, I turning off my stream.
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Now I know why everybody hates you.
    (voice) tarik: Thank you everybody, for watching. I'm super tired, I'm super fucking tired.

    [inaudible]

    (voice) tarik: Everyone go to sleep, I hope everyone enjoyed.
    (voice) tarik: And I see you next time. Thank you, again.
    
Just like `TACO` last week, `fREAKAZOID` thinks `s1mple` is mad:
    
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Yeah, I think you are mad dude.
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Yeah, you go drink .. a protein shake.
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: ... skinny butt.

    (voice) tarik: Have a good day. (smile)

Here `tarik` is still slowly turning off his stream, but `s1mple` has started his own
specifically to record this conversation:

    (voice) fREAKAZOID: It's OK to hate your life. It's alright, man.
    (voice) tarik: See you later guys.
    
He still does not understand that it is actully `fREAKAZOID` bullying him, he thinks it is `Stewie2k` being toxic:
    
    (voice) s1mple: Stewie, what are you talking about?
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: Hey, have a nice day.
    (voice) s1mple: Thank you.
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: You should have jump [??]...
    (voice) fREAKAZOID: ... some kills. I would appreciate that, bro.
    (voice) s1mple: OK, thank you.
    
Now that `s1mple` sees that his stream started recording, he asks the fake `Stewie2k` *"What you want?"*
to put it on record.
    
    (voice) s1mple: What you want?
    (voice) tarik: WTF is goin on?
    (voice) s1mple: WTF are you want, Stewie?
    (voice) tarik: hehe
    (voice) s1mple: What you talking about?
    (voice) s1mple: Can you just leave this room? Seriously.
    
And gets interrupted, by the other guys. Exactly at this moment `fREAKAZOID` stops the conversation,
probably he saw that `s1mple` started streaming or was told by the other guys.

Other guys understand that `s1mple` thinks he is talking with `Stewie2k` and are making fun:

    (voice) tarik: Bro, Stewie, calm the fuck down, bro.
    (voice) SileNt: Stewie so toxic, man.
    (voice) s1mple: Stewie, please leave this room.
    (voice) SileNt: s1mple, you think Stewie the worst player on Cloud9?
    (voice) s1mple: Yes. [pause]
    
`s1mple` thinks that the *fake* `Stewie2k` is still in team speak:    
    
    (voice) s1mple: Agh, hahah, he gonna be more mad, if I say it one more time.   
    (voice) s1mple: I just open my stream, maybe that's why he is calm down.
    
`tarik` finally ends his very long process of shutting down his stream.
    
    (voice) tarik: See you later, have a good night.
    (voice) s1mple: See you, yeah.

`SileNt` continues to make fun of `s1mple`:
    
    (voice) s1mple: Stewie, can you say something more for Reddit or HLTV?
    (voice) SileNt: You're crazy man, why would Stewie talk to you like that?
    (voice) s1mple: I don't know.
    (voice) SileNt: What did you do to Stewie?
    (voice) s1mple: Maybe because I delete him from Steam?
    (voice) s1mple: Yeah, OMG. Sorry, Stewie! If you want, you can add me again.

    (voice) s1mple: OK, it's good that I record this.
    (voice) s1mple: Because he can talk it when I'm not streaming.
    (voice) s1mple: Hey guys, everyone who is watching my stream,
    (voice) s1mple: just copy this and give it to Reddit or HLTV,
    (voice) s1mple: because he is sooo toxic.
    (voice) s1mple: Stewie, hello!
    (voice) s1mple: OMG
        
    (voice) s1mple: Silent, are you here?
    (voice) n0thing (on stewie's PC): Yo, my teammate is AFK, what's up dude?
    (voice) SileNt: That's Stewie ... shut up dude.
    (voice) s1mple: n0thing, how are you?
    (voice) SileNt: Stewie's had enough of you.
    (voice) s1mple: n0thing, how are you?
    (voice) n0thing (on stewie's PC): Just fucking chilling.
    (voice) s1mple: hahaha
    (voice) n0thing (on stewie's PC): Watching TV shows.

Explains his *Twitch* viewers what is happening:

    (voice) s1mple: So, Stewie just come on this teamspeak and start talking shit.
    (voice) s1mple: I'm just like, man I don't want to talking with you.
    (voice) s1mple: I'm like. What are you talking about? STFU. Everyone hates you.
    (voice) s1mple: Because I can just start [??] and you will not say anything,
    (voice) s1mple: I will just record every word what you say.

`s1mple` goes to check Twitch chat and *HLTV* for what really happened:

    (voice) s1mple: Who it was Stewie or fREAKAZOID? Who?
    (voice) s1mple: OMG, guys, just record this.
    (voice) s1mple: Aghhh, it was fREAKAZOID, OK, then nevermind.

Stops his stream.

## Discussion

It would be interesting to know if `fREAKAZOID` actually knew that `tarik` was streaming. At some point `tarik` says
that he is closing his stream, so at least that could have given a hint to `fREAKAZOID` that `tarik` was streaming.
He could have know that `tarik` was streaming all along, however, then why would he stop the conversation exactly
after `s1mple` started streaming. `m0e` [joined that team speak](http://oddshot.tv/shot/m0e-tv-20160218113941834) as well 
although he was playing a different match, this implies that *pros* knew there was a fight on that channel, and they just 
tuned in to listen.

Another interesting point to understand is whether `fREAKAZOID` knew that `s1mple` thought he is talking with
`Stewie2k` this whole conversation.

Also, other players in the team speak knew full well that it was `fREAKAZOID` speaking but nobody told that to `s1mple`. Instead, they proceeded in making fun of that.

Interesting how `fREAKAZOID` accused `s1mple` of baiting when he actually was *No. 1* entry fragger in the world in 2015 by HLTV. And is currently at the top of the ranking for January 2015:
